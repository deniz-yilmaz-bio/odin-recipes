# Odin Recipes

In this project I made a webpage with links to three different favorite recipes of mine. What I really took away from this project was how to standardize commit messages and you can see my messages improving further into the project. Description texts in all pages belong to me so it might be a little cringy. Another thing I really learned was how to replicate pages with similar layouts efficiently.
