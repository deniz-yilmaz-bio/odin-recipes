      <h2>How To Make Cajun Fried Chicken</h2>

      <h3>Ingredients</h3>

      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>One (3- to 4- pound) chicken, cut into 10 pieces</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>5 dashes Louisiana hot sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk, (either low-fat or full-fat), shaken well</li>
        <li>
          3 cups lard, vegetable shortening, mild vegetable oil, or bacon
          drippings
        </li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>

      <ol class="steps">
        <li>
          Pat the chicken dry. Place the chicken in a large bowl, season it with
          the salt, pepper, cayenne, white pepper, garlic powder, and hot sauce,
          and toss to coat evenly. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour and
          up to 1 day.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove the chicken from the bowl, allowing any liquid to drip back
          into the bowl, and place it in a clean bowl. Pour the buttermilk over
          the top.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat the lard, vegetable shortening, or bacon fat in a large cast-iron
          skillet until it registers 350°F (176°C) on an instant-read
          thermometer or a pinch of flour immediately sizzles when dropped into
          the fat.
        </li>
        <li>
          While the oil heats, remove the chicken from the buttermilk, allowing
          any excess liquid to drip off, and place the chicken in yet another
          clean bowl.
        </li>
        <li>Sprinkle the chicken with the flour and toss to coat.</li>
        <li>
          When the oil is ready, add the chicken pieces to the skillet in
          batches, starting with the larger pieces and shaking off any excess
          flour before adding them to the oil. Do not crowd the skillet. For the
          crispest results, you want ample room around each piece in the oil.
          Cook the chicken, using tongs to turn the chicken occasionally, until
          golden brown and cooked through, about 8 minutes on each side. Keep an
          eye on the temperature of the oil, making sure the oil doesn't get too
          hot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the fried chicken to a plate lined with paper towels or a
          brown paper bag. Return the oil to temperature before frying each
          subsequent batch of chicken. The smaller pieces will take about 6
          minutes on each side.
        </li>
