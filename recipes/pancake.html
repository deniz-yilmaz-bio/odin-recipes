      <h2>How To Make Pancakes</h2>
      <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol class="steps">
        <li>
          Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt together in a large bowl.
          Make a well in the center and add milk, melted butter, and egg; mix
          until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Heat a lightly oiled griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Pour or
          scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for
          each pancake; cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 2
          to 3 minutes. Flip and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat
          with remaining batter.
