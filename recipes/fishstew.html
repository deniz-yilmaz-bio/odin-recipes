        <li>½ tablespoon chopped fresh oregano</li>
        <li>1 pinch minced fresh rosemary</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Steps</h3>

      <ol class="steps">
        <li>
          Puree cherry tomatoes and clam juice in a blender until smooth. Press
          mixture through a fine-mesh strainer into a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          Combine 3 tablespoons olive oil, green onions, garlic, anchovy, and 1
          pinch red pepper flakes in a cold plan. Place over medium heat. Cook
          and stir until garlic and onions just start to soften, about 3
          minutes. Stir in the tomato mixture. Bring to a simmer over
          medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium and simmer stew until color
          deepens, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add halibut and shrimp to the stew. Season with salt. Increase heat to
          high. Cover pan and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5
          minutes. Stir in parsley, basil, oregano, and rosemary. Pour stew into
          a warm bowl. Drizzle in remaining olive oil and sprinkle 1 pinch red
          pepper flakes on top. Serve with crusty bread.
